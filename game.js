          The world is not always as it seems in PROJECT-A. Subtle tears in the
          fabric of reality can give way to rabbit holes filled with dreams,
          terrors, or unknown histories. Over the last several years I have
          spent a lot of my time both building and solving crypto puzzles with
          some of my friends from DEFCON. PROJECT-A will be filled with hidden
          content in every way I can find to hide it. Every public announcement,
          character, or even the game files themselves may contain another piece
          of the puzzle.
